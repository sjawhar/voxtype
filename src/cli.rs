Voxtype is a push-to-talk voice-to-text tool for Linux.
Optimized for Wayland, works on X11 too.

COMMANDS:
  voxtype                  Start the daemon (with evdev hotkey detection)
  voxtype daemon           Same as above
  voxtype record toggle    Toggle recording (for compositor keybindings)
  voxtype record start     Start recording
  voxtype record stop      Stop recording and transcribe
  voxtype status           Show daemon status (integrates with Waybar)
  voxtype setup            Check dependencies and download models
  voxtype config           Show current configuration

EXAMPLES:
  voxtype setup model      Interactive model selection (Whisper, Parakeet, or Moonshine)
  voxtype setup waybar     Show Waybar integration config
  voxtype setup gpu        Manage GPU acceleration (Vulkan/CUDA/ROCm)
  voxtype setup onnx       Switch between Whisper and ONNX engines
  voxtype status --follow --format json   Waybar integration

See 'voxtype <command> --help' for more info on a command.
See 'man voxtype' or docs/INSTALL.md for setup instructions.
