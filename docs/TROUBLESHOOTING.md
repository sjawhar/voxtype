## Modifier Key Interference (Hyprland/Sway/River)

### Typed text triggers window manager shortcuts instead of inserting text

**Symptoms:** When using compositor keybindings with modifiers (e.g., `SUPER+CTRL+X` or `SUPER+O`), releasing keys slowly causes typed output to trigger shortcuts instead of inserting text. For example, if you release X while still holding SUPER, the transcribed "hello" might trigger SUPER+h, SUPER+e, SUPER+l, etc.

**Cause:** The compositor tracks physical keyboard state. Even though voxtype types text, if you're still physically holding a modifier key, the compositor combines them.

**Solution:** Use the compositor setup command to automatically install a fix that blocks modifier keys during text output.

**For Hyprland:**
```bash
voxtype setup compositor hyprland
hyprctl reload
systemctl --user restart voxtype
```

**For Sway:**
```bash
voxtype setup compositor sway
swaymsg reload
systemctl --user restart voxtype
```

**For River:**
```bash
voxtype setup compositor river
# Restart River or source the new config
systemctl --user restart voxtype
```

**Note:** This command does NOT set up keybindings—it only installs the modifier interference fix. See the [User Manual](USER_MANUAL.md#compositor-keybindings) to set up your push-to-talk hotkey.

This command:
1. Writes a modifier-blocking submap/mode to `~/.config/hypr/conf.d/voxtype-submap.conf` (or `sway/conf.d/voxtype-mode.conf`, or `river/conf.d/voxtype-mode.sh`)
2. Adds pre/post output hooks to your voxtype config
3. Checks that your compositor config sources the conf.d directory

If voxtype crashes while typing, press **F12** to escape the submap and restore normal modifier behavior.

**Manual setup:** See `voxtype setup compositor hyprland --show` for the full configuration if you prefer to set it up manually.

**Alternative workaround:** If you can't use submaps, a simple delay before typing may help:

```toml
[output.post_process]
command = "sleep 0.3 && cat"
timeout_ms = 5000
```

### Compositors Without Mode/Submap Support

The automatic fix (`voxtype setup compositor`) only works on compositors that support input modes or submaps:

| Compositor | Supported | Why |
|------------|-----------|-----|
| Hyprland | Yes | Has submaps |
| Sway | Yes | Has modes |
| River | Yes | Has modes |
| Qtile | No | No mode/submap concept |
| Niri | No | No mode/submap concept |
| GNOME | No | No mode/submap concept |
| KDE | No | No mode/submap concept |

**For unsupported compositors, use one of these alternatives:**

1. **Use a dedicated key without modifiers** - Keys like ScrollLock, Pause, or F13-F24 don't have this problem since there are no modifiers to interfere:
   ```toml
   [hotkey]
   key = "SCROLLLOCK"
   ```

2. **Use the post-processor delay** (works on any compositor):
   ```toml
   [output.post_process]
   command = "sleep 0.3 && cat"
   timeout_ms = 5000
   ```
   This gives you 300ms to release all keys before typing starts.

3. **Use voxtype's built-in evdev hotkey** instead of compositor keybindings - release timing doesn't matter since voxtype controls the entire recording flow.

## Hotkey Detection on KDE Plasma

### Meta+modifier hotkeys not detected (evdev mode)

**Symptoms:** When using evdev hotkey detection (`[hotkey] enabled = true`) on KDE Plasma, hotkeys like Meta+Shift, Meta+Ctrl, or Meta+Alt are not detected. Voxtype shows no events in debug logs when these keys are pressed. Non-modifier keys with Meta work fine (e.g., Meta+RightAlt).

**Example:**
```toml
[hotkey]
enabled = true
key = "LEFTSHIFT"
modifiers = ["LEFTMETA"]
```

Pressing Meta+Shift produces no debug output. Changing to `key = "RIGHTALT"` with the same modifiers works correctly.

**Cause:** KDE Plasma grabs Meta+modifier combinations (Meta+Shift, Meta+Ctrl, Meta+Alt) at the compositor level for desktop switching, window management, and other shortcuts. The compositor handles these key combinations before they reach evdev, preventing voxtype from receiving the events. This is compositor behavior, not a voxtype bug.

The kernel delivers these events correctly (visible via `sudo evtest`), but KDE prevents them from reaching applications using evdev.

**Workarounds:**

**1. Use compositor keybindings instead of evdev (recommended)**

Disable evdev hotkey detection and bind voxtype commands directly in KDE System Settings:

```toml
[hotkey]
enabled = false  # Disable evdev, use compositor bindings instead
```

Then set up KDE shortcuts:
1. Open System Settings → Shortcuts → Custom Shortcuts
2. Create a new shortcut for `voxtype record toggle`
3. Assign it to your desired key combination (e.g., Meta+Shift)

This approach works reliably because the compositor processes the hotkey before any grabbing happens.

**2. Disable conflicting KDE shortcuts**

If you want to use evdev mode, remove KDE shortcuts that use your target hotkey:

1. Open System Settings → Shortcuts
2. Search for shortcuts using Meta+Shift (or your target combination)
3. Disable or rebind conflicting shortcuts
4. Test with `voxtype -vv` to verify events are received

**3. Use non-modifier target keys**

Keys like F13-F24, ScrollLock, or Pause are not grabbed by KDE:

```toml
[hotkey]
enabled = true
key = "SCROLLLOCK"
modifiers = ["LEFTMETA"]  # Meta+ScrollLock works
```

Or use a single non-modifier key without any modifiers:

```toml
[hotkey]
enabled = true
key = "SCROLLLOCK"  # No modifiers needed
```

**4. Use Alt+Shift with correct key ordering**

On KDE, Alt+Shift has strict ordering requirements. This configuration works reliably:

```toml
[hotkey]
enabled = true
key = "LEFTALT"
modifiers = ["LEFTSHIFT"]  # Press Shift first, then Alt
```

Press Shift first, then Alt while holding Shift. This avoids KDE keyboard layout switching and works consistently.

**Note:** This is not a voxtype limitation. Any application using evdev on KDE Plasma will experience the same behavior with Meta+modifier hotkeys. The compositor keybinding approach is the most reliable solution on KDE.

---

## Permission Issues

### "Cannot open input device" or "Permission denied"

**Cause:** User is not in the `input` group, required for evdev access.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add user to input group
sudo usermod -aG input $USER

# IMPORTANT: Log out and back in for changes to take effect
# Verify membership
groups | grep input
```

### "Failed to access /dev/input/event*"

**Cause:** udev rules preventing access, or input group not applied.

**Solution:**
1. Verify group membership: `groups | grep input`
2. If not shown, log out and back in completely
3. If still failing, check udev rules:
```bash
ls -la /dev/input/event*
# Should show group 'input' with rw permissions
```

### "Unable to create uinput device" (ydotool)

**Cause:** uinput module not loaded or wrong permissions.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Load uinput module
sudo modprobe uinput

# Make it persistent
echo "uinput" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/uinput.conf

# Check ydotool daemon
systemctl --user status ydotool
```

---

## Audio Problems

### "No audio captured" or empty transcriptions

**Possible causes and solutions:**

#### 1. Wrong audio device selected

```bash
# List available audio sources
pactl list sources short

# Test recording with system default
arecord -d 3 -f S16_LE -r 16000 test.wav
aplay test.wav
```

If test recording works, check your Voxtype config:
```toml
[audio]
device = "default"  # Or specific device name from pactl
```

#### 2. Microphone muted or volume too low

```bash
# Check PulseAudio/PipeWire volume
pavucontrol
# Or
pactl list sources | grep -A 10 "Default"
```

#### 3. PipeWire/PulseAudio not running

```bash
# Check audio server status
pactl info

# Restart if needed
systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse
# Or for PulseAudio:
systemctl --user restart pulseaudio
```

### "Audio format not supported"

**Cause:** Audio device doesn't support 16kHz sample rate.

**Solution:** Voxtype handles resampling internally, but ensure your device works:
```bash
# Test at native rate
arecord -d 2 test.wav
aplay test.wav
```

### Recording stops unexpectedly

**Cause:** `max_duration_secs` limit reached.

**Solution:** Increase the limit:
```toml
[audio]
max_duration_secs = 120  # 2 minutes
```

---

## Transcription Issues

### "Model not found"

**Cause:** Whisper model not downloaded or wrong path.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Download the model
voxtype setup --download

# Or manually download
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/voxtype/models
curl -L -o ~/.local/share/voxtype/models/ggml-base.en.bin \
    https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-base.en.bin
```

### Voxtype crashes during transcription

**Cause:** On some systems (particularly with glibc 2.42+ like Ubuntu 25.10), the whisper-rs FFI bindings crash due to C++ exceptions crossing the FFI boundary.

**Solution:** Use the CLI backend which runs whisper-cli as a subprocess:

```toml
[whisper]
backend = "cli"
```

This requires `whisper-cli` to be installed. Build it from [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp
cd whisper.cpp
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
sudo cp build/bin/whisper-cli /usr/local/bin/
```

See [CLI Backend](USER_MANUAL.md#cli-backend-whisper-cli) in the User Manual for details.

### Poor transcription accuracy

**Possible causes:**

#### 1. Using wrong model
- For English: Use `.en` models (e.g., `base.en`)
- For accuracy: Use larger models (`small.en`, `medium.en`)

#### 2. Audio quality issues
- Use a quality microphone
- Reduce background noise
- Maintain consistent distance from mic

#### 3. Wrong language setting
```toml
[whisper]
model = "base.en"  # For English
language = "en"
```

#### 4. Context window optimization

Context window optimization is disabled by default because it can cause phrase repetition with some models (especially large-v3 and large-v3-turbo).

If you want faster transcription and your model works well with it, you can enable it:

```toml
[whisper]
context_window_optimization = true
```

Or via command line:
```bash
voxtype --whisper-context-optimization daemon
```

If you experience phrase repetition (e.g., "word word word"), make sure this setting is disabled (the default).

### Transcription includes "[BLANK_AUDIO]" or similar

**Cause:** Recording contains mostly silence.

**Solution:**
- Check microphone is working
- Increase microphone sensitivity
- Speak closer to the microphone

### Hallucinations (transcribed text not spoken)

**Cause:** Known Whisper behavior with silence or noise.

**Solutions:**
1. Use a larger model for better accuracy
2. Avoid recording ambient noise
3. Keep recordings short and speech-focused

### Phrase repetition (same words repeated multiple times)

**Cause:** Known issue with Whisper large-v3 models, especially when context window optimization is enabled.

**Example:** Saying "increase the limit" produces "increase the limit increase the limit increase the limit"

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure `context_window_optimization` is disabled (the default):
   ```toml
   [whisper]
   context_window_optimization = false
   ```
2. Try a different model (large-v3-turbo and large-v3 are most affected)
3. If using context optimization and experiencing issues, disable it

---

## Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

### VAD filters too aggressively (rejects recordings with speech)

**Symptom:** VAD rejects recordings that contain speech, showing "No speech detected" in notifications or logs.

**Cause:** The detection threshold is too high for your microphone or environment.

**Solution:** Lower the threshold. The default is 0.5. Values closer to 0.0 are more sensitive:

```toml
[vad]
enabled = true
threshold = 0.2  # More sensitive, less likely to reject speech
```

You can also reduce `min_speech_duration_ms` if very short utterances are being rejected:

```toml
[vad]
enabled = true
threshold = 0.3
min_speech_duration_ms = 50  # Accept shorter speech segments (default: 100)
```

### VAD model not found (Whisper VAD backend)

**Symptom:** Error about missing VAD model when using `backend = "whisper"` or `backend = "auto"` with the Whisper engine.

**Solution:** Download the Silero VAD model:

```bash
voxtype setup vad
```

Alternatively, switch to the energy backend which requires no model download:

```toml
[vad]
enabled = true
backend = "energy"
```

### VAD doesn't filter silence

**Symptom:** VAD is enabled but silent recordings still get transcribed, producing hallucinations.

**Possible causes:**
1. Background noise above the threshold. Lower your microphone gain or raise the threshold:
   ```toml
   [vad]
   enabled = true
   threshold = 0.7  # Require louder speech
   ```
2. The energy backend may be less accurate than the Whisper backend for borderline cases. Try switching:
   ```toml
   [vad]
   enabled = true
   backend = "whisper"  # More accurate, requires: voxtype setup vad
   ```

**Debugging:** Run with verbose logging to see VAD decisions:

```bash
voxtype -vv
```

Look for log messages about speech detection to understand what VAD is doing with your recordings.

## Output Problems

### wtype not working on KDE Plasma or GNOME Wayland

**Symptom:** wtype fails with "Compositor does not support the virtual keyboard protocol"

**Cause:** KDE Plasma and GNOME do not implement the `zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1` Wayland protocol that wtype requires. This is a compositor limitation, not a voxtype bug.

**What happens:** Voxtype detects this failure and automatically falls back to dotool, then ydotool. If neither is set up, it falls back to clipboard mode.

**Solution 1 (Recommended):** Install dotool. Unlike ydotool, dotool does not require a daemon and supports keyboard layouts for non-US keyboards:

```bash
# 1. Install dotool (check your distribution's package manager)
# Arch (AUR):
yay -S dotool
# From source: https://sr.ht/~geb/dotool/

# 2. Add user to input group (required for uinput access)
sudo usermod -aG input $USER
# Log out and back in for group change to take effect

# 3. Configure keyboard layout if needed (non-US keyboards)
# Add to config.toml:
# [output]
# dotool_xkb_layout = "de"  # German, French ("fr"), etc.
```

**Solution 2:** Set up ydotool as your typing backend. Unlike dotool, ydotool requires a daemon to be running:

```bash
# 1. Install ydotool
# Arch:
sudo pacman -S ydotool
# Fedora:
sudo dnf install ydotool
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install ydotool

# 2. Enable and start the daemon (required!)
systemctl --user enable --now ydotool

# 3. Verify it's running
systemctl --user status ydotool
```

**Important:** For ydotool, simply having it installed is not enough. The daemon must be running for the fallback to work.

**Alternative:** Use clipboard or paste mode instead of type mode:

```toml
[output]
mode = "clipboard"  # Copies to clipboard, you paste manually
# or
mode = "paste"      # Copies to clipboard, then simulates Ctrl+V
```

**Compositor compatibility:**

| Desktop | wtype | dotool | ydotool | Recommended |
|---------|-------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Hyprland | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | wtype |
| Sway | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | wtype |
| River | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | wtype |
| KDE Plasma (Wayland) | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | dotool |
| GNOME (Wayland) | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | dotool |
| X11 (any desktop) | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | dotool |

---

### Text output not working on X11

**Symptom:** You're running X11 (not Wayland) and see errors like:
```
WARN  wtype failed: Wayland connection failed
WARN  clipboard (wl-copy) failed: Text injection failed
ERROR Output failed: All output methods failed.
```

**Cause:** wtype and wl-copy are Wayland-only tools. On X11, voxtype needs dotool, ydotool, or xclip installed.

**Solution:** Install one of these X11-compatible tools:

**Option 1 (Recommended): Install dotool**

dotool works on X11, supports keyboard layouts, and doesn't need a daemon:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian (from source):
sudo apt install libxkbcommon-dev
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~geb/dotool
cd dotool && ./build.sh && sudo cp dotool /usr/local/bin/

# Arch (AUR):
yay -S dotool

# Add user to input group
sudo usermod -aG input $USER
# Log out and back in
```

**Option 2: Install ydotool**

ydotool works on X11 but requires a running daemon:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install ydotool

# Start the daemon (see "ydotool daemon not running" section for Fedora)
systemctl --user enable --now ydotool
```

**Option 3: Use clipboard mode with xclip**

For clipboard-only output (you paste manually with Ctrl+V):

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install xclip
```

Then configure voxtype to use clipboard mode:
```toml
[output]
mode = "clipboard"
```

**Verify your setup:**

```bash
voxtype setup
```

This shows which output tools are installed and available.

---

### Wrong characters on non-US keyboard layouts (y/z swapped, QWERTZ, AZERTY)

**Symptom:** Transcribed text has wrong characters. For example, on a German keyboard, "Python" becomes "Pzthon" and "zebra" becomes "yebra" (y and z are swapped).

**Cause:** ydotool sends raw US keycodes and doesn't support keyboard layouts. When voxtype falls back to ydotool (e.g., on X11, Cinnamon, or when wtype fails), characters are typed as if you had a US keyboard layout.

**Solution:** Install dotool and configure your keyboard layout. Unlike ydotool, dotool supports keyboard layouts via XKB:

```bash
# 1. Install dotool
# Arch (AUR):
yay -S dotool
# Ubuntu/Debian (from source):
# See https://sr.ht/~geb/dotool/ for instructions
# Fedora (from source):
# See https://sr.ht/~geb/dotool/ for instructions

# 2. Add user to input group (required for uinput access)
sudo usermod -aG input $USER
# Log out and back in for group change to take effect

# 3. Configure your keyboard layout in config.toml:
```

Add to `~/.config/voxtype/config.toml`:

```toml
[output]
dotool_xkb_layout = "de"  # German QWERTZ
```

Common layout codes:
- `de` - German (QWERTZ)
- `fr` - French (AZERTY)
- `es` - Spanish
- `uk` - Ukrainian
- `ru` - Russian
- `pl` - Polish
- `it` - Italian
- `pt` - Portuguese

For layout variants (e.g., German without dead keys):

```toml
[output]
dotool_xkb_layout = "de"
dotool_xkb_variant = "nodeadkeys"
```

**Alternative:** Use paste mode, which copies text to the clipboard and simulates Ctrl+V. This works regardless of keyboard layout:

```toml
[output]
mode = "paste"
```

**Note:** The keyboard layout fix requires voxtype v0.5.0 or later. If you're on an older version, upgrade first.

---

### "ydotool daemon not running"

**Cause:** ydotool systemd service not started, or configured incorrectly for your distribution.

**Solution:** The setup varies by distribution:

#### Arch Linux (user service)

Arch provides a user-level service that runs in your session:

```bash
# Enable and start ydotool as a user service
systemctl --user enable --now ydotool

# Verify it's running
systemctl --user status ydotool
```

#### Fedora (system service)

Fedora provides a system-level service that requires additional configuration to work with your user:

```bash
# 1. Enable and start the system service
sudo systemctl enable --now ydotool

# 2. Edit the service to allow your user to access the socket
sudo systemctl edit ydotool
```

Add this content (replace `1000` with your user/group ID from `id -u` and `id -g`):

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/ydotoold --socket-path="/run/user/1000/.ydotool_socket" --socket-own="1000:1000"
```

Then restart:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ydotool

# Verify it's running
systemctl status ydotool
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian

Check which service type is available:

```bash
# Check for user service
systemctl --user status ydotool

# If not found, check for system service
systemctl status ydotool
```

If only a system service exists, follow the Fedora instructions above.

#### Verify ydotool works

```bash
# Test that ydotool can type
ydotool type "test"
```

If you see "Failed to connect to socket", the daemon isn't running or the socket permissions are wrong.

### Text not typed / nothing happens

**Possible causes:**

#### 1. ydotool not working
```bash
# Test ydotool directly
ydotool type "test"
```

#### 2. Fallback to clipboard not working
```bash
# Test wl-copy
echo "test" | wl-copy
wl-paste
```

#### 3. Application blocking input
Some applications (terminals, games) may block simulated input.

**Solution:** Use clipboard mode:
```toml
[output]
mode = "clipboard"
```

### Characters dropped or garbled

**Cause:** Typing too fast for the application.

**Solution:** Increase typing delay:
```toml
[output]
type_delay_ms = 10  # Try 10-50ms
```

### Clipboard not working

**Cause:** wl-copy not installed or Wayland session issue.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install wl-clipboard
# Arch: sudo pacman -S wl-clipboard
# Debian: sudo apt install wl-clipboard
# Fedora: sudo dnf install wl-clipboard

# Test it works
echo "test" | wl-copy
wl-paste
```

### Clipboard not restored after paste

**Cause:** The restore delay may be too short for your application, or `wl-paste` is not installed.

**Solution:**

1. Make sure `wl-clipboard` is installed (provides both `wl-copy` and `wl-paste`):
```bash
# Arch: sudo pacman -S wl-clipboard
# Debian: sudo apt install wl-clipboard
# Fedora: sudo dnf install wl-clipboard
```

2. If the clipboard is restored before the application reads it, increase the delay:
```toml
[output]
restore_clipboard_delay_ms = 500  # Try 300-500ms for slow applications
```

3. On X11, make sure `xclip` is installed for clipboard restoration support.

### No desktop notification

**Cause:** notify-send not installed or notifications disabled.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install libnotify
# Arch: sudo pacman -S libnotify
# Debian: sudo apt install libnotify-bin
# Fedora: sudo dnf install libnotify

# Test
notify-send "Test" "This is a test"
```

---

## Performance Issues

### Slow transcription

**Solutions:**

1. **Use a smaller model:**
```toml
[whisper]
model = "tiny.en"  # Fastest
```

2. **Increase thread count:**
```toml
[whisper]
threads = 8  # Match your CPU cores
```

3. **Use English-only model:**
`.en` models are faster than multilingual models.

### High CPU usage

**Cause:** Whisper inference is CPU-intensive.

**Solutions:**
1. Limit threads:
```toml
[whisper]
threads = 4  # Limit CPU usage
```

2. Use smaller model:
```toml
[whisper]
model = "tiny.en"
```

### High memory usage

**Cause:** Large Whisper models require significant RAM.

| Model | Approximate RAM |
|-------|-----------------|
| tiny.en | ~400 MB |
| base.en | ~500 MB |
| small.en | ~1 GB |
| medium.en | ~2.5 GB |
| large-v3 | ~4 GB |

**Solution:** Use a smaller model if RAM is limited.

### Hotkey lag / delayed recording start

**Cause:** System load or evdev latency.

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure voxtype is running with normal priority
2. Check for other applications using evdev
3. Try a different hotkey

---

## Systemd Service Issues

### Service fails to start

# Common issues:
# - Not in input group (log out/in after adding)
# - Model not downloaded
# - ydotool not running
```

### Service starts but doesn't work

**Cause:** Session environment not available.

**Solution:** Ensure you're running under a graphical session:
```bash
# Check environment
echo $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
echo $WAYLAND_DISPLAY
```

### Service doesn't start on login

```bash
# Enable the service
systemctl --user enable voxtype

## Feedback

We want to hear from you! Voxtype is a young project and your feedback helps make it better.

- **Something not working?** If Voxtype doesn't install cleanly, doesn't work on your system, or is buggy in any way, please [open an issue](https://github.com/peteonrails/voxtype/issues). I actively monitor and respond to issues.
- **Like Voxtype?** I don't accept donations, but if you find it useful, a star on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/peteonrails/voxtype) would mean a lot!
